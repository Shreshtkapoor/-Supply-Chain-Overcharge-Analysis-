# -Supply-Chain-Overcharge-Analysis-
This project analyzes courier billing discrepancies for an e-commerce company to identify overcharges and undercharges in shipping costs. By comparing expected vs. billed charges, we detect instances where the company paid extra or saved money. The analysis is based on weight slabs, delivery zones, and rate cards.
